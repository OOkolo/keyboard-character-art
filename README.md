## TASK: Turn photos into ascii characters by using computer vision to form the image

## **`Description`:**

During the advent of the Tik Tok "Adult Swim" trend, where users would post videos that featured a surprise appearance from the Adult Swim logo, I wanted to share a Tik-Tok. 
With this goal, I forked a Github python script, made some edits and was able to come up with a script that turns logos into ascii characters. 
I tested it with the Nike Logo
